# Predictive-analysis-of-heart-disease-using-ECG-data
This project involves developing a deep learning model to predict heart diseases using ECG (electrocardiogram) data.
The goal is to create a robust predictive system that can classify individuals at risk of heart diseases based on their ECG readings. 
By leveraging signal processing techniques and statistical analysis, you will extract relevant features from the ECG data, such as heart rate, variability, and waveform characteristics, and use them to train and optimize a classification model.
